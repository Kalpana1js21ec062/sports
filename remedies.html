            <p><ol>
                <li><u><b>Rest</b></u> : Give the strained muscle adequate time to heal by resting it. Avoid activities that could further strain or aggravate the muscle.</li><br>

                <li><u><b>Gentle Stretching</b></u> : After the acute pain has subsided, gently stretch the strained muscle to improve flexibility and prevent stiffness.</li><br>
                <li><u><b>Massage Therapy</b></u> : Gentle massage around the strained muscle can help promote blood flow, reduce muscle tension, and alleviate pain.</li><br>
                <li><u><b>Hydration and Nutrition</b></u> : Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, which supports overall muscle health and healing. Ensure you're getting a balanced diet rich in nutrients like protein, vitamins, and minerals to support muscle repair.</li><br>
